# Documentation

This repository contains answers and examples for two main topics:

1. **Django Signals**
2. **Python Custom Classes (Rectangle Class)**

## Topics

### 1. Django Signals
For detailed answers and code examples related to Django Signals, please refer to the file:  
[`django_signals.md`](./django_signals.md)

This document includes answers to the following questions:
- Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously?
- Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
- Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?

### 2. Python Custom Classes (Rectangle Class)
For explanations and code on Python custom classes, specifically the `Rectangle` class with `__iter__` functionality, refer to the file:  
[`rectangle_class.py`](./rectangle_class.py)

This script demonstrates:
- How to define a Python class (`Rectangle`) with a custom `__iter__` method to allow iteration over the object's attributes.
- Example usage of the class and how to iterate over its dimensions (`length` and `width`).

---

### How to Use
- **To understand Django Signals**: Open `django_signals.md` for in-depth explanations and code examples.
- **To learn about Python Custom Classes**: Review the `rectangle_class.py` file for how to create iterable classes in Python.

Feel free to explore these files for clear and practical examples!
